# GIT TIPS

- git status: show current status
- git add:    add files to be committed
- git commit -m 'message': commit changes w/ meaningful message



# Basic workflow

- try to break up the problems into simpler problem (maybe on paper or in code comments, or rubber duck method)
- try to code one of these smaller parts/problems
- test above chunk to make sure it works 
- then git add (changed files) related to that chunk
- git commit -m 'message describes chunk of work'
- *repeat the above
